<html><p></p><p>Given a set of reviews provided by the customers for different hotels and a string containing “Good Words”,  you need to sort the reviews in descending order according to their “Goodness Value” (Higher goodness value first). We define the “Goodness Value” of a string as the number of “Good Words” in that string.</p><p>Note:  Sorting should be stable. If review i and review j have the same “Goodness Value” then their original order would be preserved.</p><p> You are expected to use Trie in an Interview for such problems </p><p>Constraints:</p><p>1.   1 &lt;= No.of reviews &lt;= 200</p><p>2.   1 &lt;= No. of words in a review &lt;= 1000</p><p>3.   1 &lt;= Length of an individual review &lt;= 10,000</p><p>4.   1 &lt;= Number of Good Words &lt;= 10,000</p><p>5.   1 &lt;= Length of an individual Good Word &lt;= 4</p><p>6.   All the alphabets are lower case (a - z)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Input:</p><p>S : A string S containing "Good Words" separated by  "_" character. (See example below)</p><p>R : A vector of strings containing Hotel Reviews. Review strings are also separated by "_" character.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Output:</p><p>A vector V of integer which contain the original indexes of the reviews in the sorted order of reviews. </p><p></p><p>V[i] = k  means the review R[k] comes at i-th position in the sorted order. (See example below)</p><p>In simple words, V[i]=Original index of the review which comes at i-th position in the sorted order. (Indexing is 0 based)</p><p></p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p>Input: </p><p>S = "cool_ice_wifi"</p><p>R = ["water_is_cool", "cold_ice_drink", "cool_wifi_speed"]</p><p></p><p>Output:</p><p>ans = [2, 0, 1]</p><p>Here, sorted reviews are ["cool_wifi_speed", "water_is_cool", "cold_ice_drink"]</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
