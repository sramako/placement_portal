<html><p></p><p>You are given the following :</p><p></p><p>A positive number N</p><p>Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue</p><p>Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P)  that gives the number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P</p><p></p><p>You need to return  list of actual order of personsâ€™s height</p><p>Consider that heights will be unique</p><p>Example</p><p>Input : </p><p>Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4</p><p>InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2</p><p></p><p></p><p>Output : </p><p>actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4 </p><p></p><p></p><p>So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence Infronts has 0 for him.</p><p>For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.</p><p>You can do similar inference for other people in the list.</p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
