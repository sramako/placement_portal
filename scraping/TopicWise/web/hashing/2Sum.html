<html><p></p><p>Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.</p><p>The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 &lt; index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2 ) are not zero-based. </p><p>Put both these numbers in order in an array and return the array from your function ( Looking at the function signature will make things clearer ). Note that, if no pair exists, return empty list.</p><p>If multiple solutions exist, output the one where index2 is minimum. If there are multiple solutions with the minimum index2, choose the one with minimum index1 out of them.</p><p>Input: [2, 7, 11, 15], target=9</p><p>Output: index1 = 1, index2 = 2</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
