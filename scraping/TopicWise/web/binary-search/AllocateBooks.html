<html><p></p><p>N number of books are given. </p><p>The ith book has Pi number of pages. </p><p>You have to allocate books to M number of students so that maximum number of pages alloted to a student is minimum. A book will be allocated to exactly one student. Each student has to be allocated at least one book.  Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.</p><p>NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible</p><p>Input:</p><p>List of Books</p><p>M number of students</p><p></p><p></p><p>Your function should return an integer corresponding to the minimum number.</p><p>Example:</p><p>P : [12, 34, 67, 90]</p><p>M : 2</p><p></p><p>Output : 113</p><p></p><p>There are 2 number of students. Books can be distributed in following fashion : </p><p>  1) [12] and [34, 67, 90]</p><p>      Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 34 + 67 + 90 = 191 pages</p><p>  2) [12, 34] and [67, 90]</p><p>      Max number of pages is allocated to student 2 with 67 + 90 = 157 pages </p><p>  3) [12, 34, 67] and [90]</p><p>      Max number of pages is allocated to student 1 with 12 + 34 + 67 = 113 pages</p><p></p><p>Of the 3 cases, Option 3 has the minimum pages = 113. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
