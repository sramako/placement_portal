Does your current solution work? How does the time complexity change?*</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROBLEM APPROACH:</p><p>Note: If you know the number of times the array is rotated, then this problem becomes trivial. If the number of rotation is x, then minimum element is A[x].</p><p>Lets look at how we can calculate the number of times the array is rotated.</p><p>Complete solution in the hints.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
