<html><p></p><p>Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,</p><p>add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).</p><p>The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.</p><p>Example:</p><p>If the vector has [1, 2, 3]</p><p>the returned vector should be [1, 2, 4]</p><p>as 123 + 1 = 124.</p><p></p><p>NOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer.</p><p>For example, for this problem, following are some good questions to ask :</p><p></p><p>Q : Can the input have 0’s before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?</p><p></p><p>A : For the purpose of this question, YES</p><p></p><p>Q : Can the output have 0’s before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?</p><p>A : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
