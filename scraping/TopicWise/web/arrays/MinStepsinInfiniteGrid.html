Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.</p><p>Input :</p><p>Given two integer arrays A and B, where A[i] is x coordinate and B[i] is y coordinate of ith point respectively.</p><p>Output :</p><p>Return an Integer, i.e minimum number of steps.</p><p>Example :</p><p></p><p>Input : [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]</p><p>Output : 2</p><p></p><p></p><p>It takes 1 step to move from (0, 0) to (1, 1). It takes one more step to move from (1, 1) to (1, 2).</p><p>This question is intentionally left slightly vague. Clarify the question by trying out a few cases in the “See Expected Output” section.</p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
