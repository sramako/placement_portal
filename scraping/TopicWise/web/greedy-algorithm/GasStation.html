<html><p></p><p>There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].</p><p>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</p><p>Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.</p><p>You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, ... n-1, 0, 1, 2..</p><p>Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.</p><p>Example :</p><p>Input :</p><p>      Gas :   [1, 2]</p><p>      Cost :  [2, 1]</p><p></p><p>Output : 1 </p><p></p><p>If you start from index 0, you can fill in gas[0] = 1 amount of gas. Now your tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need cost[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1. </p><p>If you start from index 1, you can fill in gas[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your tank has 2 units of gas. You need cost[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So, you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in gas[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you cost[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function.
