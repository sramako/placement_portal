<html><p></p><p>There is a row of seats. Assume that it contains N seats adjacent to each other. There is a group of people who are already seated in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together &amp; some are scattered.</p><p>An occupied seat is marked with a character 'x' and an unoccupied seat is marked with a dot ('.')</p><p>Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other, without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps to move them should be minimum.</p><p>Return minimum value % MOD where MOD = 10000003</p><p>Example</p><p>Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) -</p><p></p><p>              . . . . x . . x x . . . x . .</p><p></p><p>Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -</p><p>                  . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .</p><p></p><p>Following are the steps to achieve this -</p><p>1 - Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index -  </p><p>    Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2</p><p></p><p>2 - Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index - </p><p>    Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3</p><p></p><p>So now the total number of jumps made = </p><p>    ( 2 + 3 ) % MOD = </p><p>    5 which is the minimum possible jumps to make them seat together.</p><p></p><p>There are also other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 and that will not be minimum.</p><p></p><p>For example bring them all towards the starting of the row i.e. start placing them from index 0. </p><p>In that case the total number of jumps will be </p><p>    ( 4 + 6 + 6 + 9 )%MOD </p><p>    = 25 which is very costly and not an optimized way to do this movement</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function.
