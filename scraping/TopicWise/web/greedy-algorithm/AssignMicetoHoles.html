<html><p></p><p>There are N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. </p><p>Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse. </p><p>A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.</p><p>Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.</p><p>Example:</p><p>positions of mice are:</p><p>4 -4 2</p><p>positions of holes are:</p><p>4 0 5</p><p></p><p>Assign mouse at position x=4 to hole at position x=4 : Time taken is 0 minutes </p><p>Assign mouse at position x=-4 to hole at position x=0 : Time taken is 4 minutes </p><p>Assign mouse at position x=2 to hole at position x=5 : Time taken is 3 minutes </p><p>After 4 minutes all of the mice are in the holes.</p><p></p><p>Since, there is no combination possible where the last mouse's time is less than 4, </p><p>answer = 4.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Input:</p><p>A :  list of positions of mice</p><p>B :  list of positions of holes</p><p></p><p></p><p>Output:</p><p>single integer value</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: The final answer will fit in a 32 bit signed integer.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
