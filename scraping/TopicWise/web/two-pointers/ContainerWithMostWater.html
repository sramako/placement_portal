But this is 2D plane we are working with for simplicity ).</p><p></p><p>Note: You may not slant the container.</p><p></p><p>Example :</p><p>Input : [1, 5, 4, 3]</p><p>Output : 6</p><p></p><p>Explanation : 5 and 3 are distance 2 apart. So size of the base = 2. Height of container = min(5, 3) = 3. </p><p>So total area = 3 * 2 = 6</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
