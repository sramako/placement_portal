<html><p></p><p>On a N * M chessboard, where rows are numbered from 1 to N and columns from 1 to M, there are queens at some cells. Return a N * M  array A, where A[i][j] is number of queens that can attack cell (i, j). While calculating answer for cell (i, j), assume there is no queen at that cell.</p><p>Notes:</p><p></p><p>Queen is able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally on a chessboard. A queen cannot jump over another queen to attack a position.</p><p>You are given an array of N strings, each of size M. Each character is either a 1 or 0  denoting if there is a queen at that position or not, respectively.</p><p>Expected time complexity is worst case O(N*M).</p><p></p><p>For example,</p><p>Let chessboard be,</p><p>[0 1 0]</p><p>[1 0 0]</p><p>[0 0 1]</p><p></p><p>where a 1 denotes a queen at that position.</p><p></p><p>Cell (1, 1) is attacked by queens at (2, 1), (1,2) and (3,3).</p><p>Cell (1, 2) is attacked by queen at (2, 1). Note that while calculating this, we assume that there is no queen at (1, 2).</p><p>Cell (1, 3) is attacked by queens at (3, 3) and (1, 2).</p><p>and so on...</p><p></p><p>Finally, we return matrix</p><p>[3, 1, 2]</p><p>[1, 3, 3]</p><p>[2, 3, 0]</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
