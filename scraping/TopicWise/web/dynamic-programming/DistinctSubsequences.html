<html><p></p><p>Given two sequences S, T, count number of unique ways in sequence S, to form a subsequence that is identical to the sequence T.</p><p></p><p>Subsequence : A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none ) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).</p><p></p><p>Example :</p><p>S = "rabbbit" </p><p>T = "rabbit"</p><p></p><p></p><p>Return 3. And the formations as follows:</p><p>S1= "ra_bbit" </p><p>S2= "rab_bit" </p><p>S3="rabb_it"</p><p></p><p></p><p>"_" marks the removed character.</p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
