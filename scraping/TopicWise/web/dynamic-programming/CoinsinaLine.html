The player with the larger amount of money wins. Assume that you go first.</p><p>Write a program which computes the maximum amount of money you can win.</p><p>Example:</p><p>suppose that there are 4 coins which have value</p><p>1 2 3 4</p><p>now you are first so you pick 4</p><p>then in next term</p><p>next person picks 3 then</p><p>you pick 2 and</p><p>then next person picks 1</p><p>so total of your money is 4 + 2 = 6</p><p>next/opposite person will get 1 + 3 = 4</p><p>so maximum amount of value you can get is 6</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
