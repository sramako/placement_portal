<html><p></p><p>You are given a sequence of black and white horses, and a set of K stables numbered 1 to K. You have to accommodate the horses into the stables in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p></p><p></p><p>You fill the horses into the stables preserving the relative order of horses. For instance, you cannot put horse 1 into stable 2 and horse 2 into stable 1. You have to preserve the ordering of the horses.</p><p>No stable should be empty and no horse should be left unaccommodated.</p><p>Take the product (number of white horses * number of black horses) for each stable and take the sum of all these products. This value should be the minimum among all possible accommodation arrangements</p><p></p><p></p><p>Example:</p><p></p><p>Input: {WWWB} , K = 2</p><p>Output: 0</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>We have 3 choices {W, WWB}, {WW, WB}, {WWW, B}</p><p>for first choice we will get 1*0 + 2*1 = 2.</p><p>for second choice we will get 2*0 + 1*1 = 1.</p><p>for third choice we will get 3*0 + 0*1 = 0.</p><p></p><p>Of the 3 choices, the third choice is the best option. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>If a solution is not possible, then return -1</p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
