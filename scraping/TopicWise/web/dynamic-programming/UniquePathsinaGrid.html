<html><p></p><p>Given a grid of size m * n, lets assume you are starting at (1,1) and your goal is to reach (m,n). At any instance, if you are on (x,y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).</p><p>Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?</p><p>An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.</p><p>Example :</p><p>There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.</p><p>[</p><p>  [0,0,0],</p><p>  [0,1,0],</p><p>  [0,0,0]</p><p>]</p><p></p><p></p><p>The total number of unique paths is 2.</p><p></p><p>Note: m and n will be at most 100.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.</p><p>                                  Still have a doubt?
