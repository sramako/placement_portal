<html><p></p><p>Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.</p><p>You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line.</p><p>Pad extra spaces ‘ ‘ when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.</p><p>Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.</p><p>If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.</p><p>For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.</p><p>Your program should return a list of strings, where each string represents a single line.</p><p>Example:</p><p>words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]</p><p>L: 16.</p><p>Return the formatted lines as:</p><p>[</p><p>   "This    is    an",</p><p>   "example  of text",</p><p>   "justification.
