Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.
Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
