Given expression with operands and operators (OR , AND , XOR) , in how many ways can you evaluate the expression to true, by grouping in different ways? Operands are only true and false.
Input:
string :  T|F&T^T
here '|' will represent or operator 
     '&' will represent and operator
     '^' will represent xor operator
     'T' will represent true operand
     'F' will false


Output:
different ways % MOD
where MOD = 1003


Example:
string : T|F
only 1 way (T|F) => T
so output will be 1 % MOD = 1




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
