Given a string, find if there is any sub-sequence that repeats itself.
A sub-sequence of a string is defined as a sequence of characters generated by deleting some characters in the string without changing the order of the remaining characters.
Input:
string
Output:
0/1
0 -> No
1 -> Yes 


Example:
abab ------> yes, ab is repeated. So, return 1. 
abba ------> No, a and b follow different order. So, return 0. 


NOTE : sub-sequence length should be greater than or equal to 2


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
