Given A, how many structurally unique BST’s (binary search trees) that store values 1...A?
Example :
Given A = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST’s.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
