A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26


Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.
Example :
Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
