Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
Example : 
Given 
s = "aab",
Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
