Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0’s and 1’s, find the largest rectangle containing all ones and return its area.
Bonus if you can solve it in O(n^2) or less.
Example :
A : [  1 1 1
       0 1 1
       1 0 0 
    ]

Output : 4 

As the max area rectangle is created by the 2x2 rectangle created by (0,1), (0,2), (1,1) and (1,2)





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
