Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.
Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
Example :
Input : [1 2 1 2]
Output : 2

Explanation : 
  Day 1 : Buy 
  Day 2 : Sell
  Day 3 : Buy
  Day 4 : Sell




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
