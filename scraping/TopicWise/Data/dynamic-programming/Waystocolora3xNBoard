Given a 3Xn board,  find the number of ways to color it using at most 4 colors such that no two adjacent boxes have same color. Diagonal neighbors are not treated as adjacent boxes. 
Output the ways%1000000007 as the answer grows quickly.
1<= n < 100000
Example:
Input: n = 1
Output: 36


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
