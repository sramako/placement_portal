Given a set of strings. Find the length of smallest string which
has all the strings in the set as substring
Constraints:
1) 1 <= Number of strings <= 18
2) Length of any string in the set will not exceed 100.
Example:
Input: [“abcd”, “cdef”, “fgh”, “de”]
Output: 8 (Shortest string: “abcdefgh”)


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
