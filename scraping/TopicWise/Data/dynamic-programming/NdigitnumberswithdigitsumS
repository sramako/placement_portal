Find out the number of N digit numbers, whose digits on being added  equals to a given number S. Note that a valid number starts from digits 1-9 except the number 0 itself. i.e. leading zeroes are not allowed.
Since the answer can be large, output answer modulo 1000000007
****
N = 2, S = 4 
 Valid numbers are {22, 31, 13, 40} 
 Hence output 4.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
