Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example :
Input : 

    [  1 3 2
       4 3 1
       5 6 1
    ]

Output : 8
     1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
