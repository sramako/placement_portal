Given two sequences S, T, count number of unique ways in sequence S, to form a subsequence that is identical to the sequence T.

Subsequence : A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none ) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

Example :
S = "rabbbit" 
T = "rabbit"


Return 3. And the formations as follows:
S1= "ra_bbit" 
S2= "rab_bit" 
S3="rabb_it"


"_" marks the removed character.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
