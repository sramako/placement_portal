Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
For example, given
s = "myinterviewtrainer",
dict = ["trainer", "my", "interview"].


Return 1 ( corresponding to true ) because "myinterviewtrainer" can be segmented as "my interview trainer".
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
