Given two arrays A & B of size N each.
Find the maximum n elements from the sum combinations (Ai + Bj) formed from elements in array A and  B.
For example if A = [1,2], B = [3,4], then possible pair sums can be 1+3 = 4  , 1+4=5  ,   2+3=5   ,    2+4=6
and maximum 2 elements are 6, 5
Example:
N = 4
a[]={1,4,2,3}
b[]={2,5,1,6}
Maximum 4 elements of combinations sum are
10   (4+6), 
9    (3+6),
9    (4+5),
8    (2+6)




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
