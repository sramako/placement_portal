You are given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ,…, AN and an integer K. Return the of count of distinct numbers in all windows of size K.
Formally, return an array of size N-K+1 where i’th element in this array contains number of distinct elements in sequence Ai, Ai+1 ,…, Ai+k-1.
Note:

If K > N, return empty array.

For example,
A=[1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3] and K = 3

All windows of size K are

[1, 2, 1]
[2, 1, 3]
[1, 3, 4]
[3, 4, 3]

So, we return an array [2, 3, 3, 2].




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
