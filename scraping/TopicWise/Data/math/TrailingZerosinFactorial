Given an integer n, return the number of trailing zeroes in n!.
Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.
Example :
n = 5
n! = 120 
Number of trailing zeros = 1
So, return 1




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
