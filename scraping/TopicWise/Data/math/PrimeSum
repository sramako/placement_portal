Given an even number ( greater than 2 ), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number.
NOTE A solution will always exist. read Goldbachâ€™s  conjecture
Example:

Input : 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4



If there are more than one solutions possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.
If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b,
and [c,d] is another solution with c <= d, then

[a, b] < [c, d] 

If a < c OR a==c AND b < d. 




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
