Given a string, find the rank of the string amongst its permutations sorted lexicographically. 
Assume that no characters are repeated.
Example :
Input : 'acb'
Output : 2

The order permutations with letters 'a', 'c', and 'b' : 
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba


The answer might not fit in an integer, so return your answer % 1000003


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
