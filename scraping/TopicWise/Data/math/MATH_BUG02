Given a non negative integer A,
following code tries to find all pair of integers (a, b) such that


a and b are positive integers
a <= b, and
a2 + b2 = A.
0 <= A <= 100000


However, the code has a small bug. Correct the bug and submit the code.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
