Implement pow(x, n) % d.
In other words, given x, n and d,
find   (xn  % d)
Note that remainders on division cannot be negative. 
In other words, make sure the answer you return is non negative.
Input : x = 2, n = 3, d = 3
Output : 2

2^3 % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2.




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
