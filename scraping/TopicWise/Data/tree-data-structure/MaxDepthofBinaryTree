Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

NOTE : The path has to end on a leaf node.

Example :
         1
        /
       2


max depth = 2.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
