Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.
Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem
Example :
Input : 

   1       1
  / \     / \
 2   3   2   3

Output : 
  1 or True




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
