Given a binary tree, print a vertical order traversal of it.
Example :
Given binary tree:
      6
    /   \
   3     7
  / \     \
 2   5     9


returns
[
    [2],
    [3],
    [6 5],
    [7],
    [9]
]



Note : If 2 Tree Nodes shares the same vertical level then the one with lesser depth will come first.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
