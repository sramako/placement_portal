Given a binary search tree, write a function to find the kth smallest element in the tree.
Example :
Input : 
  2
 / \
1   3

and k = 2

Return : 2

As 2 is the second smallest element in the tree.



NOTE : You may assume 1 <= k <= Total number of nodes in BST



NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
