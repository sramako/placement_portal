Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Example :
Input :
        Preorder : [1, 2, 3]
        Inorder  : [2, 1, 3]

Return :
            1
           / \
          2   3





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
