Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
Example :
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3


The above binary tree is symmetric. 
But the following is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3


Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
