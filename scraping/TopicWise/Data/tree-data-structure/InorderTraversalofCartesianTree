Given an inorder traversal of a cartesian tree, construct the tree.

Cartesian tree :  is a heap ordered binary tree, where the root is greater than all the elements in the subtree.


Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

Example :
Input : [1 2 3]

Return :   
          3
         /
        2
       /
      1




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
