Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

Balanced tree : a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example :

Given A : [1, 2, 3]
A height balanced BST  : 

      2
    /   \
   1     3





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
