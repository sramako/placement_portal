Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
Example :
Given

         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6


The flattened tree should look like:
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6


Note that the left child of all nodes should be NULL.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
