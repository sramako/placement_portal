Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodesâ€™ values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
Example : 
Given binary tree
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7


return
[
         [3],
         [20, 9],
         [15, 7]
]




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
