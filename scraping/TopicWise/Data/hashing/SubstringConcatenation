You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length.
Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.
Example :
S: "barfoothefoobarman"
L: ["foo", "bar"]


You should return the indices: [0,9].
(order does not matter).


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
