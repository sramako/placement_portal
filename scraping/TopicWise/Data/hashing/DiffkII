Given an array A of integers and another non negative integer k, find if there exists 2 indices i and j such that A[i] - A[j] = k, i != j.
Example :
Input :
A : [1 5 3]
k : 2


Output :
1


as 3 - 1 = 2

Return 0 / 1 for this problem.



NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
