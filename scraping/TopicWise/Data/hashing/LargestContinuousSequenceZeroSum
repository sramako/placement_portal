Find the largest continuous sequence in a array which sums to zero.
Example:

Input:  {1 ,2 ,-2 ,4 ,-4}
Output: {2 ,-2 ,4 ,-4}




NOTE : If there are multiple correct answers, return the sequence which occurs first in the array.



NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
