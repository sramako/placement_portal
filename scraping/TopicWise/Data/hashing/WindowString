Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in linear time complexity.
Note that when the count of a character C in T is N, then the count of C in minimum window in S should be at least N.
Example :
S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
T = "ABC"


Minimum window is "BANC"

Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string ''.
If there are multiple such windows, return the first occurring minimum window ( with minimum start index ).




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
