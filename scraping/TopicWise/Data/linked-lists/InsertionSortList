Sort a linked list using insertion sort.
We have explained Insertion Sort at Slide 7 of Arrays
Insertion Sort Wiki has some details on Insertion Sort as well.
Example :
Input : 1 -> 3 -> 2

Return 1 -> 2 -> 3




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
