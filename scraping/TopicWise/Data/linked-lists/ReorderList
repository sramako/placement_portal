Given a singly linked list
    L: L0 → L1 → … → Ln-1 → Ln,


reorder it to:
    L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …


You must do this in-place without altering the nodes’ values.
For example,
Given {1,2,3,4}, reorder it to {1,4,2,3}.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
