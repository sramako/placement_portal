Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
Try solving it using constant additional space.
Example :
Input : 

                  ______
                 |     |
                 \/    |
        1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

Return the node corresponding to node 3. 




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
