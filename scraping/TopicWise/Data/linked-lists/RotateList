Given a list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.
For example:
Given 1->2->3->4->5->NULL and k = 2,
return 4->5->1->2->3->NULL.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
