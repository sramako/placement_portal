Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.
Example :
Input : 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3

Returned list : 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
