Given a singly linked list, determine if its a palindrome. Return 1 or 0 denoting if its a palindrome or not, respectively.
Notes:

Expected solution is linear in time and constant in space.

For example,
List 1-->2-->1 is a palindrome.
List 1-->2-->3 is not a palindrome.




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
