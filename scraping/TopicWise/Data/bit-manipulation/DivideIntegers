Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.
Return the floor of the result of the division.
Example:
5 / 2 = 2


Also, consider if there can be overflow cases. For overflow case, return INT_MAX.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
