Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.
Find that element which does not appear thrice.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.
Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example :
Input : [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output : 4




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
