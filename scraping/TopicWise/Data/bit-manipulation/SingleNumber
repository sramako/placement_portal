Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example :
Input : [1 2 2 3 1]
Output : 3




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
