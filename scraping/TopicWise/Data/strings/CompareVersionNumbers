Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.


If version1 > version2 return 1,
If version1 < version2 return -1,
otherwise return 0.


You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.
The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.
Here is an example of version numbers ordering:
0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 1.13 < 1.13.4




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
