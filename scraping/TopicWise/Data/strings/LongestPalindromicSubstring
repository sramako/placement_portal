Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S.
Substring of string S:
S[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(S)
Palindrome string:
A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, S is palindrome if reverse(S) = S.
Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index ).
Example :
Input : "aaaabaaa"
Output : "aaabaaa"




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
