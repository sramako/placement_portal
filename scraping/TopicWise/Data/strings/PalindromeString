Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
Example:
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
