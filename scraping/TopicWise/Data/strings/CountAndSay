The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...


1 is read off as one 1 or 11.
11 is read off as two 1s or 21.
21 is read off as one 2, then one 1 or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
Example:
if n = 2,
the sequence is 11.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
