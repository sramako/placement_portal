Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. 
Return the sum of the three integers.
Assume that there will only be one solution
Example: 
given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, 
and target = 1.
The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
