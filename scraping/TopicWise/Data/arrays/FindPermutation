Given a positive integer n and a string s consisting only of letters D or I, you have to find any permutation of first n positive integer that satisfy the given input string.
D means the next number is smaller, while I means the next number is greater.
Notes

Length of given string s will always equal to n - 1
Your solution should run in linear time and space.

Example :
Input 1:

n = 3

s = ID

Return: [1, 3, 2]





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
