Youâ€™re given a read only array of n integers. Find out if any integer occurs more than n/3 times in the array in linear time and constant additional space.
If so, return the integer. If not, return -1.
If there are multiple solutions, return any one.
Example :
Input : [1 2 3 1 1]
Output : 1 
1 occurs 3 times which is more than 5/3 times. 




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
