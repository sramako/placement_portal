Given numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascal’s triangle.
Pascal’s triangle : To generate A[C] in row R, sum up A’[C] and A’[C-1] from previous row R - 1.
Example:
Given numRows = 5,
Return
[
     [1],
     [1,1],
     [1,2,1],
     [1,3,3,1],
     [1,4,6,4,1]
]




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
