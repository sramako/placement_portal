Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.
For example:
Given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
For this problem, return the maximum sum.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
