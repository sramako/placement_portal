Given an array A of integers, find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] <= A[j].
If there is no solution possible, return -1.
Example :
A : [3 5 4 2]

Output : 2 
for the pair (3, 4)





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
