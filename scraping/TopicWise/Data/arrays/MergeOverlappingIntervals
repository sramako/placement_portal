Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
For example:
Given [1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18],
return [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].
Make sure the returned intervals are sorted.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
