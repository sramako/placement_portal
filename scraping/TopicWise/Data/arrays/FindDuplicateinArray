Given a read only array of n + 1 integers between 1 and n, find one number that repeats in linear time using less than O(n) space and traversing the stream sequentially O(1) times.
Sample Input:
[3 4 1 4 1]


Sample Output:
1


If there are multiple possible answers ( like in the sample case above ), output any one.
If there is no duplicate, output -1


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
