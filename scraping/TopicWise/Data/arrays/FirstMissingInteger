Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.
Example:
Given [1,2,0] return 3,
[3,4,-1,1] return 2,
[-8, -7, -6] returns 1
Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and use constant space.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
