Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
For example:
Given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
