Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it.
Examples:
path = "/home/", => "/home"
path = "/a/./b/../../c/", => "/c"


Note that absolute path always begin with ‘/’ ( root directory )
Path will not have whitespace characters.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
