Write a program to validate if the input string has redundant braces?
Return 0/1
0 -> NO
1 -> YES


Input will be always a valid expression
and operators allowed are only + , * , - , /
Example:
((a + b)) has redundant braces so answer will be 1
(a + (a + b)) doesn't have have any redundant braces so answer will be 0





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
