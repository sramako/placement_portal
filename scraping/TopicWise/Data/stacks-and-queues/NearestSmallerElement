Given an array, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.
More formally,
G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that 
    j is maximum possible AND 
    j < i AND
    A[j] < A[i]


Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider next smaller element as -1.
Example:
Input : A : [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]
Return : [-1, 4, -1, 2, 2]
Example 2:
Input : A : [3, 2, 1]
Return : [-1, -1, -1]


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
