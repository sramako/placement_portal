Implement pow(A, B) % C.
In other words, given A, B and C, 
find (AB)%C.
Input : A = 2, B = 3, C = 3
Return : 2 
2^3 % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2


PROBLEM APPROACH :
Complete solution in the hint.





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
