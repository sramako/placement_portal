Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.

Note:

Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
Also, the subsets should be sorted in ascending ( lexicographic ) order.
The list is not necessarily sorted.


Example :
If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:
[
  [],
  [1],
  [1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [1, 3],
  [2],
  [2, 3],
  [3],
]




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
