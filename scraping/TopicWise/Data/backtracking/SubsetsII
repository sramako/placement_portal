Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, S, return all possible subsets.

Note:

Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
The subsets must be sorted lexicographically.


Example :
If S = [1,2,2], the solution is:
[
[],
[1],
[1,2],
[1,2,2],
[2],
[2, 2]
]




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
