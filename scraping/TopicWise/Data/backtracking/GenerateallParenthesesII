Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses of length 2*n.
For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
"((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"


Make sure the returned list of strings are sorted.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
