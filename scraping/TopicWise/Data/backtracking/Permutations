Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.
Example:
[1,2,3] will have the following permutations:
[1,2,3]
[1,3,2]
[2,1,3] 
[2,3,1] 
[3,1,2] 
[3,2,1]



NOTE

No two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.
For the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.



Warning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS.
Example : next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python.
If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.



NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
