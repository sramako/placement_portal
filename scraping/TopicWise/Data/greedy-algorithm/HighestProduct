Given an array of integers, return the highest product possible by multiplying 3 numbers from the array
Input:
array of integers e.g {1, 2, 3}



NOTE:  Solution will fit in a 32-bit signed integer

Example:
[0, -1, 3, 100, 70, 50]

=> 70*50*100 = 350000





NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
