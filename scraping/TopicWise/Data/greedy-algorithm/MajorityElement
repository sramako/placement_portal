Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than floor(n/2) times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
Example :
Input : [2, 1, 2]
Return  : 2 which occurs 2 times which is greater than 3/2. 




NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
