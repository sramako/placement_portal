There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.


What is the minimum candies you must give?
Sample Input :
Ratings : [1 2]


Sample Output :
3


The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2+1 = 3 candies need to be given out.


NOTE: You only need to implement the given function. Do not read input, instead use the arguments to the function. Do not print the output, instead return values as specified.
